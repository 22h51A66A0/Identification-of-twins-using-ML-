Prediction of Identical Twins using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on differentiating identical twins using advanced machine learning techniques. Identical twins pose a challenge for traditional facial recognition systems, which struggle to distinguish between nearly identical faces. Our solution applies machine learning models to extract and analyze subtle facial features, improving accuracy in twin identification.

Objective
To develop a system that accurately identifies whether a given face belongs to an identical twin or a unique individual.
To enhance forensic investigations and security applications by improving face recognition techniques.
To utilize image processing and machine learning to achieve high-precision results.
Methodology
Dataset Collection & Preprocessing

A dataset of real and identical twin images is used.
Image processing techniques such as bilateral filtering, grayscale conversion, and object detection are applied.
Machine Learning Models

Naïve Bayes Algorithm: A probabilistic approach used for classification.
Random Forest Algorithm: An ensemble learning method providing higher accuracy.
Model Training & Evaluation

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are used to evaluate model performance.
A confusion matrix visualizes correct and incorrect classifications.
